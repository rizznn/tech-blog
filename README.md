# tech-blog
This is a CMS-style blog site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts as well. This app follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
